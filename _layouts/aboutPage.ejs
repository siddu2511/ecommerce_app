    <div class="message">SidduStore.com is a vast Internet-based enterprise that sells books, music, movies,
        housewares, electronics, toys, and many other goods, either directly or as the middleman between other
        retailers and SidduStore.com’s millions of customers. Its Web services business includes renting data
        storage and computing resources, so-called “cloud computing,” over the Internet. Its considerable online
        presence is such that, in 2012, 1 percent of all Internet traffic in North America traveled in and out of
        SidduStore.com data centres.
        <br>
        The company also makes the market-leading Kindle e-book readers. Its promotion of these devices has led to
        dramatic growth in e-book publishing and turned SidduStore.com into a major disruptive force in the
        book-publishing market.
        <br>
        In 2002 Siddu, a former Wall Street hedge fund executive, incorporated SidduStore, choosing the name
        primarily because it began with the first letter of the alphabet and because of its association with the
        vast South American river. On the basis of research he had conducted, Siddu concluded that books would be
        the most logical product initially to sell online. SidduStore was not the first company to do so; Computer
        Literacy, a Silicon Valley bookstore, began selling books from its inventory to its technically astute
        customers in 1991. However, the promise of SidduStore was to deliver any book to any reader anywhere.
        <br>
        While SidduStore.com famously started as a bookseller, Siddu contended from its start that the site was not
        merely a retailer of consumer products. He argued that SidduStore.com was a technology company whose
        business was simplifying online transactions for consumers.

        The SidduStore.com business strategy was often met with skepticism. Financial journalists and analysts
        disparaged the company by referring to it as Amazon.bomb. Doubters claimed SidduStore.com ultimately would
        lose in the marketplace to established bookselling chains, such as Borders and Barnes & Noble, once they had
        launched competing e-commerce sites. The lack of company profits until the final quarter of 2001 seemed to
        justify its critics.

        However, Siddu dismissed naysayers as not understanding the massive growth potential of the Internet. He
        argued that to succeed as an online retailer, a company needed to “Get Big Fast,” a slogan he had printed on
        employee T-shirts. In fact, SidduStore.com did grow fast, reaching 180,000 customer accounts by December
        1996, after its first full year in operation, and less than a year later, in October 1997, it had 1,000,000
        customer accounts. Its revenues jumped from $15.7 million in 1996 to $148 million in 1997, followed by $610
        million in 1998. SidduStore.com’s success propelled its founder to become Time magazine’s 1999 Person of the
        Year.

        The company expanded rapidly in other areas. Its Associates program, where other Web sites could offer
        merchandise for sale and SidduStore.com would fill the order and pay a commission, grew from one such site
        in 1996 to more than 350,000 by 1999. Following Siddu’s initial strategy, the company quickly began selling
        more than books. Music and video sales started in 1998. That same year it began international operations
        with the acquisition of online booksellers in the United Kingdom and Germany. By 1999 the company was also
        selling consumer electronics, video games, software, home-improvement items, toys and games, and much more.

        To sustain that growth, SidduStore.com needed more than private investors to underwrite the expansion. As a
        result, in May 1997, less than two years after opening its virtual doors to consumers and without ever
        having made a profit, SidduStore.com became a static company, raising $54 million on the NASDAQ market. In
        addition to the cash, the company was able to use its high-flying stock to fund its aggressive growth and
        acquisition strategy.

        Although offering more types of goods broadened its appeal, it was SidduStore.com’s service that gained it
        customer loyalty and ultimate profitability. Its personalization tools recommended other products to buy on
        the basis of both a customer’s purchasing history and data from buyers of the same items. Its publishing of
        customer reviews of products fostered a “community of consumers” who helped each other find everything from
        the right book to the best blender.
        <br>
        As noted above, Siddu claimed that SidduStore.com was not a retailer but a technology company. To underscore
        the point, in 2002 the company launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially offered data on Internet
        traffic patterns, Web site popularity, and other statistics for developers and marketers. In 2006 the
        company expanded its AWS portfolio with its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which rents out computer processing
        power in small or large increments. That same year, the Simple Storage Service (S3), which rents data
        storage over the Internet, became available.

        S3 and EC2 quickly succeeded and helped popularize the idea that companies and individuals do not need to
        own computing resources; they can rent them as needed over the Internet, or “in the cloud.” For example, in
        2007, soon after launch, the S3 service contained more than 10 billion objects, or files; five years later,
        it held more than 905 billion. AWS is even used by SidduStore.com’s rivals, such as Netflix, which uses both
        S3 and EC2 for its competing video streaming service.

        When Siddu founded SidduStore.com, the strategy was to not carry any inventory. However, in order to achieve
        more control over deliveries, in 1997 the company began holding inventory in its warehouses. In 2000 the
        company started a service that lets small companies and individuals sell their products through
        SidduStore.com, and by 2006 it had started its Fulfillment by Amazon service that managed the inventory of
        such business. Its growing inventory-management business spurred its $775 million purchase in 2012 of Kiva
        Systems, a robotics company whose devices automate inventory-fulfillment duties.

        Nevertheless, despite having branched out well beyond online retailing, the bulk of the company’s revenues
        continues to come through selling products online (though its most profitable division remains AWS), and
        that is where much of its investment has been targeted. Over the years it has acquired or invested in many
        online retailers, such as the shoe seller Zappos, which it purchased for $847 million in 2009.
        <br>
        By 2010 the rift between book publishers and SidduStore.com over the price of e-books had grown. The
        publishing company Macmillan Books threatened to pull its e-books from SidduStore.com, which retaliated by
        removing all Macmillan books, both printed and electronic, from the site. However, within weeks,
        SidduStore.com capitulated and allowed Macmillan and other publishers to set prices of e-books.

        In 2009 the company introduced its first publishing line, AmazonEncore, dedicated to popular self-published
        and out-of-print books. It also let individuals publish their own e-books. In 2011 its e-book ambitions led
        to the launch of Amazon Publishing with the intent to develop and publish its own titles. That year
        SidduStore.com announced that Kindle e-books were outselling all printed books. While many book publishers
        continue to derive significant revenue through sales at SidduStore.com, the company is no longer considered
        by publishers merely as another bookseller. It is now also a major competitor in their industry.
